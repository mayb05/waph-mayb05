In this lab, I focused on session management in PHP applications. I learned how to mitigate a session hijacking attempt and secured my application. I also used wireshark to help understand the web traffic when using sessions. 

#### Task 1: Session Management in PHP 101
##### 1a: Sessiontest.php
Here are the two different browser screenshots for the results of the code.

The session is set in the first screenshot then the cookie is held in the second one.
