In this project, I designed a professional website portfolio. I had to use javascript, html, jQuery, and Web APIs to create it! I learned how to work with the APIs to connect to my website as well as experimenting with jQuery. 

#### Technical Requirements

First I took code from lab 2 to create the digital clock, and the analog clock. I also added a contact form that sends an email to my personal email. I also allowed a show/hide button of my email. For the web APIs, I used joke api and Weatherbit. For the joke API, I changed the joke types to programming only because the ANY jokes were a bit too much for a professional website despite having a disclaimer. Weatherbit required me to get my own API key which I had to sign up for and I only have trial of it. Lastly, I added the cookies greeting. The cookies greeting is created by checking the lastVisit cookie. IF it is missing, the welcome message will appear for first time visitors. Otherwise, It tells you when your last visit was! My contact form is created using Formspree, it is an API that will automatically go through the contact message and send it to my email if it is relevant.
